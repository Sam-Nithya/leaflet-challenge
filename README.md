# Leaflet-Step-1

## Project Overview

This project visualizes earthquake data using Leaflet.js, a popular JavaScript library for interactive maps. The goal is to create a dynamic map that shows earthquake activity for the past week, with earthquake markers reflecting both the magnitude and depth of each earthquake.

## Features

- **Map Display**: The map uses Leaflet.js to display earthquake data on a world map.
- **Marker Sizes**: Earthquake markers vary in size based on the earthquake's magnitude.
- **Color Coding**: Markers are color-coded based on the earthquake's depth.
- **Popups**: Each marker has a popup that displays additional information about the earthquake, including:
  - Magnitude
  - Location
  - Depth
- **Legend**: A legend is included to help users understand the color scale used for depth.
